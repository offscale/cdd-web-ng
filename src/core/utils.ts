 * @fileoverview
 * This file contains core utility functions used throughout the generator.
 * It includes functions for string manipulation (case conversion), TypeScript type resolution from
 * OpenAPI schemas, OpenAPI spec parsing helpers, and functions for generating unique DI token names.
 * These utilities are pure, dependency-free helpers that form the building blocks of the generation logic.
